## Project Overview
BetCoin is a decentralized prediction market platform that empowers communities to forecast real-world outcomes using collective intelligence. By leveraging blockchain technology, BetCoin ensures transparency, security, and trust in all market operations. Users can create, participate in, and resolve prediction markets on a wide range of topics, with token balances dynamically adjusting based on the accuracy of their probabilistic predictions.

## Blockchain Interaction
BetCoin interacts with the blockchain in the following ways:

- **Smart Contracts:** All core market logic, including market creation, participation, and resolution, is handled by smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. This ensures that all transactions are transparent, immutable, and trustless.
- **Token Staking & Rewards:** Users stake tokens when making predictions. After the outcome is resolved (using oracles), smart contracts automatically adjust token balances based on prediction accuracy, rewarding informed forecasts and penalizing inaccurate ones.
- **Oracles:** To resolve markets based on real-world events, BetCoin integrates with decentralized oracle services. Oracles securely fetch and verify event outcomes, enabling trustless and automated market settlements.
- **Wallet Integration:** Users interact with the platform via blockchain wallets, enabling secure authentication, transaction signing, and direct control over their assets.

This architecture ensures that BetCoin is fully decentralized, transparent, and resistant to manipulation, providing a fair and engaging experience for all participants.
